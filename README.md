# Offers scrapped random sample

## Aim:
Download information from a random selection of job openings using an API from a job search engine

## Output: 

CSV file called "Random_offers". If already exists, it concatenates the offers to the old file.

## Context:

I developed this code to conduct an online correspondence audit field experiment. Feel free to reach me if you would like to talk about how to implement it in a similar experiment.

This work was supported by the British Academy [PF19\100020]; the European Union-NextGenerationEU, Ministry of Universities and Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, through a call from Pompeu Fabra University [Maria Zambrano Fellowship]; and the Oxford’s Sociology Department ‘Inspiration Fund 2022’.

## Notes: 

  · This code is created to download files from www dot reed dot co dot uk API.
  
  · The execution of the file requires a .txt file in the Working Directory with the API password.
  
  · This is the first code I share publicly. Please, feel free to reach me to suggest any improvements.
